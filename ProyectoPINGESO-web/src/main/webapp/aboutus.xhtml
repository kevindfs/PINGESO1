        <p>The “Quality Indices Generator” application is a project carried out by a team of students of Computer Engineering at the “Universidad de Santiago de Chile”. 
The system aims to facilitate research through the use of indices designed for calculations in bioinformatics, where there are a large number of microbiological data that can be entered by the user.
Quality Indices Generator is able to perform, through genetic data obtained by GeneOntology, the calculation of indices such as GS2, WuPalmer, TBK, among others. 
The system is open to the entire scientific community.</p>
